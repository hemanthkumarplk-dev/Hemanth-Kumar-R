README: Data Preprocessing Steps for Titanic Dataset
Overview
This project demonstrates the preprocessing of a dataset (Titanic dataset as an example) to make it ready for machine learning models. Preprocessing includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and removing outliers.
________________________________________
Step 1: Import Dataset and Explore Basic Info
Objective: Understand the structure, data types, and identify missing values.
What was done:
o	Loaded the dataset using pandas.
o	Explored the first few rows using df.head().
o	Checked data types and null values using df.info() and df.isnull().sum().
o	Generated summary statistics with df.describe().
Outcome: Identified which columns are numerical, categorical, and which contain missing values.

Step 2: Handle Missing Values
Objective: Fill missing values to prevent errors during model training.
What was done:
o	Numerical columns (Age, Fare): Filled missing values using median for Age (robust to outliers) and mean for Fare.
o	Categorical columns (Sex, Embarked): Filled missing values using the mode (most frequent value).
Outcome: All missing values were handled, ensuring no NaNs remained in the dataset.

Step 3: Convert Categorical Features into Numerical
Objective: Convert text/categorical data into numeric format for machine learning algorithms.
What was done:
o	Binary categorical column (Sex): Mapped 'male' → 0 and 'female' → 1.
o	Multi-class categorical column (Embarked): Applied one-hot encoding to create dummy variables and dropped the first column to avoid redundancy.
Outcome: Dataset contains only numerical features ready for scaling and modeling.

Step 4: Normalize/Standardize Numerical Features
Objective: Scale numerical features so that they contribute equally to the model.
What was done:
o	Identified numerical features to scale: Age, Fare (continuous features).
o	Applied StandardScaler (mean=0, standard deviation=1) or optionally MinMaxScaler (range 0–1) to normalize values.
Outcome: Numerical features are scaled, which improves model performance, especially for distance-based algorithms (KNN, SVM) or gradient-based models.
________________________________________
Step 5: Visualize and Remove Outliers
Objective: Detect and remove extreme values that can distort model performance.
What was done:
o	Created boxplots for Age and Fare to visually detect outliers.
o	Used the IQR method to remove rows with extreme values beyond 1.5*IQR.
Outcome: Outliers were removed, resulting in a cleaner dataset with reduced skew in numerical features.

Final Dataset
•	All missing values handled.
•	Categorical features encoded numerically.
•	Numerical features scaled.
•	Outliers removed.
